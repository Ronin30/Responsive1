              <h1 class="page-title">A Snippet of Me</h1>
              <p>Originally from Cleveland, Ohio. I have lived here for 26 years. I spent 5 years in Houston, Texas, 3 of which I worked as a web/cable television content editor and as a customer service manager for the Anime Network Online, a subsidiary of Sentai Filmworks. I had a great experience there, however Cleveland's siren call drew me back home to the promised land. I am an aspiring Software Developer and I am attending Cleveland Codes in order to achieve that goal.</p>
              <p>I have many hobbies, the short list is learning, coding, cars, and keeping and breeding poison dart frogs as well as constructing zoo quality vivariums. I love giving back to the community and helping those who are less fortunate than myself, and in highschool I was awarded the President's Volunteer Service Award for the many hours I had volunteered.</p>

                <h3>What I do</h3>
                <p>I am currently a software development apprentice at Tri-c's Cleveland Codes software development bootcamp. It is my mission to become a software developer so I can create a legacy for not only my  family, but also for the company I will potentially work for.</p>
